# SQL
Developed and optimized complex SQL queries on a sample airline database to analyze flights, schedules, and transactions. Extracted actionable insights on route profitability, flight delays, and passenger trends using JOINs, CTEs, and window functions. Achieved efficient data retrieval and clear business metrics from 10+ analytical queries.

#  Advanced SQL Querying & Data Insights 

This project showcases **intermediate to advanced SQL skills** using the AirlineDB database.  
AirlineDB contains flight-related data such as transactions, tickets, airports, and flight schedules.  
The goal is to write optimized SQL queries to answer real-world business questions and deliver quantifiable insights.
